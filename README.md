## 1. TL;DR: Climate-positive bus
UrbÃ¡nika will travel 20+ cities across LatAm with a 12 meter-long bus with the main goal of facilitating the transformation of cities into smart, regenerative, and selfmanaged communities. And we want to do it in the most positive impact way possible, kilometer by kilometer and city by city.

**How?**
While outside is the school area, the whole interior design has closed cycles where waste is turned into ingredients for another process, and nature powers the entire thing.

Thanks to the help of highly committed architects and engineers, we are able to carry in the bus specialized ecotech and systems that turn:

**Grey waters** into clean water to wash dishes, cloths, take a shower, and even drink it! ðŸ’§
**Organic waste** into biogas to cook! and fertilizer to gift or sell ðŸŒ»
**Solar and wind energy** into electricity ðŸŒž
**[Cooking oil or motor oil](https://steamsystems.wixsite.com/steamsystems)** or **[decontaminant plastic to diesel](https://www.petgas.com.mx/)** to fuel the bus! ðŸšŒ
**Food production** via vertical or cylindrical farms ðŸŒ®

**We have three goals with this climate-positive transformation:**
1. Show that regenerative practices can be achieved without sacrificing lifestyle,
2. Inspire construction professionals, neighbors, municipal authorities, and business people to make the shift!,
3. Facilitate the shift through:
    a. sharing the blueprints of the bus and the tech installed,
    b. giving immersive tours within the bus,
    c. offering "Do It Yourself/Together" workshops to implement some of these practices / technologies.
    
## If you aren't reading anything else, please read only this:
We are driving over 10,000 Km, visiting 40 cities in 20 countries.
Imagine the mindset change that can be achieved when decision makers from these places get to know that...

* used oil and plastics fueled our trip! If we used only cooking oil we'll be preventing ~600,000 liters of water from being polluted...
Or if we used only plastic to diesel we'll be removing 2,800Kg of plastics from the streets and nature...

**How would decision makers re-design cities to include these alternative fuel systems?**

* turning our organic waste (~803kg/year) into cooking gas, we are avoiding the pollution of soil and water, easing the recycling process of non-organic solid waste, and producing energy that could be sold...
**How could cities, offices, restaurants, and neighborhoods take advantage of this practice?**

* turning gray waters into clean water we can reuse 70% of it instead of wasting it!

**We hope that this bus inspires the actual building of SolarPunk Cities.**
We need your help to make it happen, we are very close and now we have a team that shares this same passion and vision.

# 2. Architectural plans, render, and the climate-positive devices,

Take a look at the overall design of bus!

Wanna see more? Go to the blueprints folder "[Planos arquitÃ©ctonicos y equipo](https://github.com/Urbanika/PositiveClimate_Bus/tree/main/Planos%20arquitect%C3%B3nicos%20y%20equipo)". We'll be updating it with the most recent blueprints.

The path of getting technical specialized people onboard to make the transformation happen was not straightforward, we even got robbed by an architect, two more companies said it was not possible, and many others said if no one has done this before, it might not be possible...
BUT here we are with the team of architects: Carlos and Mariana from [9 Viento](https://www.facebook.com/9VientoArquitectos).

![9 Viento y UrbÃ¡nika](https://bafybeihnhmgbzxedilagtpgzfncq33k62vl5zghttcacfoiesot43u3sla.ipfs.dweb.link/Foto%20equipo%20con%209%20Viento.jpg)

This incredible couple came like a ray of sunshine and has conquered our hearts with their motivation and proactiveness - nothing is impossible, and since day 1 they have been working with all their passion and knowledge in making Urbanikaâ€™s bus a reality.

The engineering team comes from the well-experienced [CIMEX group](https://tranvias-cimex.mx/). They are the ones carrying out the dreams in paper to reality.

Thanks to both teams for accompanying us through this journey.

## Would you like to turn your van, bus, or house into a climate-positive house?
Glad you are! The architectural blueprint is licensed under Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal and available to be downloaded and used by anyone worldwide. Follow [this repository](https://github.com/Urbanika/PositiveClimate_Bus) and our Twitter profile to know more or ask questions.

## 3. Budget
The architects and engineers have given us a total budget of $32K USD. This budget covers the entire climate-positive transformation. The remaining budget we have from GGBeta and GG18  after buying the bus and paying the architects is about $10K, that budget is enough to cover the start of the transformation works, which most likely will begin by the end of this GG19.

However, to finish the transformation we need another $22K. Please, consider supporting us to help reach this budget!

## 4. The self-management course
This long bus adventure has a purpose - to spread UrbÃ¡nikaâ€™s course directly where people are.

We want to see emerge a mycelia of self-managed cities, and that will only happen if the units of a city (the neighborhoods) and its change makers (municipal councils, universities, activist orgs and businesses) learn and experience peer governance, commoning, and the use of open-source web3 tech.

UrbÃ¡nika's course on self-management is being developed.
We have an additional grant only for this at the Web3 and Community round. If you are able to help us there too, we will be very grateful.

### A bit of encouraging context:
A couple of weeks ago, a big real estate group from QuerÃ©taro, MÃ©xico contacted us. They've built 200 condominiums (that hold from 250 to 2500 houses each). They want to decentralize the decision-making of these (neighborhood management is not their business, but building houses) and they want our help!

We expect to start the LATAM tour with good reviews and recommendations from all these people! Wish us luck, and support us if it's in your possibilities, please!

## 5. The LATAM tour: our vision to accelerate the adoption and improvement of regen and open source initiatives
As you know, we are visiting 40 cities in 20 countries. We are staying about 1-3 months per place, that means, about 5 years of tour.

The LATAM Tour is a traveling fest with workshops, demo days, conferences, job fair, music, food, movies, and art. All related to coordination improvement, open source tech, SolarPunk narratives, postCapitalist patterns, ReFi examples, metacrisis awareness, DAO onboarding, and artivism.

If you...
developed ReFi or open source solutions,
produced educational and inspiring content to tackle the metacrisis,
have job offerings or anything that adds value to society...

then contact us!
We'll love to work together in delivering real value where it is most impactful.

## 6. We are looking for you!
1. **wanna join?** We are looking for team members to join in facilitating the emergence of self-managed, smart, and regenerative cities.

If you love urban design, LARP or boardgame design, self-management, public relations, learning experiences, ruby on rails, web3 development, or circular economy pls contact us! your help is meaningful and well appreciated.

2. **wanna support?** If it's in your possibilities, pls consider donating to us at our [Giveth](https://giveth.io/project/urbanika) or Gitcoin Campaigns.

The dream of realizing the first-ever postCapitalist traveling school that is also a climate-positive showroom is happening. Your donation will greatly help us reach the goal.

3. **sponsor or contribute to the bus and trip!** If you have a methodology or technology related to facilitating the transition toward climate-positive, carbon-neutral, or circular economy ways, then contact us! We want to promote your products. Let's find a way to help each other make it happen. 

## Those contributing with their knowledge, systems, or technology will get:
* A metal plate with their name at the part of the bus they contributed with.
* Their name at the Gratitude wall (where the names of all donors and participants of the project will be located).
* A photobook type of album with the blueprints, technical information, and summary of the technological/system contribution the provider did (for example, if contributed with the biofilter, then how does the biofilter work, and what value does it provide to society). This album will have the catalog of services that the provider has and their contact info so the interested decision makers can contact them.
* Several informational and gratitude posts in social media tagging them.
* Workshops and demo-days where we are presenting to the media, and to both public and private decision makers how the bus works. In these demostrations, we'll mention the contributors too.

If you have any other idea or request, let us know! If you are contributing to making the bus happen, we are very happy to work closely with you.
